## Lab 4


### Car Dimensions
* wheel diameter: 7.5 cm
* wheel width 2.8 cm
* tire thickness 1 cm
* body length 16.5 cm
* body width 7 cm 
* body height 3.5 cm
I chose to measure car dimensions becuase I thought that they might be useful in many of the phyics type equations that might come up throughout the course. It seems like the car will be rotating a lot throughout the course and the dimensions seem like they would be very helpful for calculating things like the moment arms/moments of interia. We also talked about how we would need to change the reference frame of many of the senors when handling incoming data, and having a good feel for the cars dimensions seemed like it would be helpful for this.
Knowing the wheel dimensions also seemed like it would be really helpful down the road. For exampe, becuase I now know the wheel diameter, if I know how fast the car is going on a non slippery surface, I can now get a good estimate how many rpms the motor is outputting. This knowledge could be helpful when trying to fine tune things such as the duty cycle of a pwm signal I am sending out. Knowing the wheel width seemed like it could be useful for some type of measurement involving slippage. One thing that I noticed, is that the tires are very easily compressible and it seems like the wheel might conform to different shapes under relatively high forces. Knowing the tire thickness could help quantify this phenomenon and give some indication of the possible shapes the tire could take on.
I just used a simple ruler to take car dimensions.
### Car Weight
The car weighs 1.15 pounds or 0.5216312 kg with the batter inside. The battery that was inside was the one that came with the car. Again this information seemed like it would be useful in any physics that we bring into the our process later in the class such as moments of interia. The information seems like it will couple nicely with the car's dimmensions moving forward.
I measured the cars weight by taking it to a local post office and asking them to weigh it.
