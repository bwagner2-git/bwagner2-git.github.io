Greetings! My name is Ben Wagner and this is a GitHub page for my fast robotics class at Cornell. I recently graduated from the Illinois Institute of Technology with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. I am now in the ECE M.Eng. program here at Cornell starting my second semester. My primary interests are embedded systems, firmware, robotics, and the IoT. test
